                    I, <b>Kelly Yee</b> am a certified Yoga Instructor (YT250) with specialized training from Duke Integrative Medicine in yoga for seniors and those living with ailments such as cancer, osteoporosis, and chronic pain. Additionally I hold a BCom., MSc., and attending Simon Fraser University in Gerontology.<br><br> 
 
                    My love for healthy living inspires me to research health sciences, integrative medicines, and age-related illnesses where Yoga could be utilized to help the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being of others.<br><br>
 
                    With many years of practicing yoga and pilates… I was on a quest to find a healthy balance between physical movement, environmental integrity and spiritual well-being.<br><br>
 
                    Moving across the country for love and personal growth, I discovered that Yoga is the healthy healing therapy I consistently came back to, for fitness, mindfulness, and connection to spirit. A sequence of events led me to meet an inspiring and motivating yoga teacher (Jason, Yoga Tree Studios). I was given the tools and knowledge to advance my practice, uncover my passion of life-long learning and discover my love for teaching.<br><br> 
 
                    After my very first teaching opportunity, I felt this joyful sensation I had never felt. The sensation lifted me to another level, right then I knew this is my path!<br><br>
 
                    I returned to my home city to create this <b><i>Yoga Health Centre!</i></b> Where aging adults and people living with chronic ailments can use yoga as a form of ongoing treatment and therapy, which allows you to <b><u>live your best quality life at any age or phase!</u></b>
